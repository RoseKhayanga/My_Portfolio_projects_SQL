# Data Cleaning SQL project

This project highlights my skills in Sql for data cleaning

-- Data Cleaning steps
-- 1) Check and Remove duplicates
-- 2)Standardisation and fix errors
-- 3)Check for null and empty cells
-- 4)Removing unnecessary rows and columns.

-- Create a staging table of the original in order to not alter the original file

 -- 2)Standardize data
 
SELECT * 
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;

-- if we look at industry it looks like we have some null and empty rows, let's take a look at these
SELECT DISTINCT industry
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY industry;

SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE industry IS NULL 
OR industry = ''
ORDER BY industry;

-- we should set the blanks to nulls since those are typically easier to work with
UPDATE world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
SET industry = NULL
WHERE industry = '';


--  we check if all blanks have been set to null
SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE industry IS NULL 
OR industry = ''
ORDER BY industry;

-- now we need to populate those nulls if possible

UPDATE layoffs_staging2 t1
JOIN layoffs_staging2 t2
ON t1.company = t2.company
SET t1.industry = t2.industry
WHERE t1.industry IS NULL
AND t2.industry IS NOT NULL;

-- and if we check it looks like Bally's was the only one without a populated row to populate this null values
SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE industry IS NULL 
OR industry = ''
ORDER BY industry;

-- I also noticed the Crypto has multiple different variations. We need to standardize that - let's say all to Crypto
SELECT DISTINCT industry
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY industry;

UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET industry = 'Crypto'
WHERE industry IN ('Crypto Currency', 'CryptoCurrency');

-- now that's taken care of:
SELECT DISTINCT industry
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY industry;

-- we also look at other columns such as country

SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;

-- everything looks good except apparently we have some "United States" and some "United States." with a period at the end. Let's standardize this.
SELECT DISTINCT country
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY country;

UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET country = TRIM(TRAILING '.' FROM country);

-- now if we run this again it is fixed
SELECT DISTINCT country
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY country;


-- We also fix the date columns:
SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;

-- we can use str to date to update this field
UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET `date` = STR_TO_DATE(`date`, '%m/%d/%Y');

-- now we can convert the data type properly
ALTER TABLE layoffs_staging2
MODIFY COLUMN `date` DATE;


SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;

-- 3. Look at Null Values

-- the null values in total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, and funds_raised_millions all look normal. 
-- so there isn't anything I want to change with the null values


-- 4. remove any columns and rows we need to

SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL;


SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL
AND percentage_laid_off IS NULL;

-- Delete Useless data we can't really use
DELETE FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL
AND percentage_laid_off IS NULL;

SELECT * 
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;

ALTER TABLE layoffs_staging2
DROP COLUMN row_num;


SELECT * 
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;
